render is used for rendering the view directly to the user - whether a 
GSP page, template, XML, JSON, text...etc. render can pass the model to 
the view which displays it to the user. 

redirect on the other hand redirects to another controller and/or action 
- passing optional parameters. The new controller/action is now 
responsible for "rendering" the view to the user.
